Description:
------------

This plugin allows to handle arbitrary custom buildsystems with KDevelop.

It supports setting up commands and arguments to build, configure, clean,
'dist-clean' and install the project, so that KDevelop's actions work as
expected.

Additionally it allows to setup include directories (or import-directories) and
defines for the project on a per-directory basis. This allows the C++ support
and other language plugins to find file-references without manually adding them
via the include-assistant.

This should help all those that have a special build setup to still be able to
embrace the features that KDevelop has to offer.

Requirements:
-------------

The only requirement is KDevPlatform, version 1.1.0 (which in turn means that
KDE Platform 4.4 or later needs to be installed too)

Installation:
-------------

See the INSTALL file.

Bugs:
-----

Please report bugs at bugs.kde.org under the KDevelop product for the 'custom
buildsystem' component.
